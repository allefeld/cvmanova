function [perms, nPerms] = signPermutations(n, maxPerms)

% generate sign permutations
%
% [perms, nPerms] = signPermutations(n, maxPerms = 5000)
%
% n:         number of data points
% maxPerms:  maximum number of permutations
% perms:     permutations, n × nPerms array of ±1
% nPerms:    number of permutations
%
% Permutations are randomly selected if the full enumeration
% is larger than maxPerms. The first permutation is always the neutral
% permutation, ones(n, 1).
