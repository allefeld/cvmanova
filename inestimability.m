function ie = inestimability(C, X)

% degree of inestimability of a contrast w.r.t. a design matrix
%
% ie = inestimability(C, X)
%
% C:    contrast matrix (column vectors)
% X:    design matrix
%
% For an estimable contrast, ie should be 0 save for numerical error.
% A number smaller than 1 indicates that the contrast has an estimable
% part. For a completely inestimable contrast, ie = 1.

% determine orthonormal basis of the range of the contrast matrix
RC = orth(C);

% determine orthonormal basis of the null space of the design matrix
NX = null(X);

% NX' * RC is a matrix of the inner products ("correlations")
% of all the C-range vectors with all the X-null vectors.
% Squared values indicate the proportion of variance of an effect described
% by a C-range vector that falls within the null-space of X.
% The worst-case proportion across the range of C is given by the matrix 2-norm:
ie = norm(NX' * RC);

% *** unnecessarily complicated? equivalent to norm(C' * pinv(X) * X - C')?
